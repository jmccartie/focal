# Overview

Centralize all the things

Your blog, your posts, your social links, your hub.

Core: blog with pages.
Ability to post status updates and pictures, which in turn, posts to enabled services, but stores them locally for easy retrieval.

Problems it solves:
* data transparency. Need a tweet from 5 years ago? no problem. need that picture from last year? it's on your own site.
* ownership. you own it all and control it. never need to get all your data "out" of a system -- those systems just contain copies
* easy to keep up with whatever social service comes around

## Ok. So What am I supposed to do with this?

1. Fork it. Tweak it. Deploy it somewhere.
2. Contribute back to the community.
